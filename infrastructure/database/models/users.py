    This class represents a User in the application.

    Attributes:
        user_id (Mapped[int]): The unique identifier of the user.
        username (Mapped[Optional[str]]): The username of the user.
        full_name (Mapped[str]): The full name of the user.
        active (Mapped[bool]): Indicates whether the user is active or not.
        language (Mapped[str]): The language preference of the user.

    Methods:
        __repr__(): Returns a string representation of the User object.

    Inherited Attributes:
        Inherits from Base, TimestampMixin, and TableNameMixin classes, which provide additional attributes and functionality.

    Inherited Methods:
        Inherits methods from Base, TimestampMixin, and TableNameMixin classes, which provide additional functionality.

    Relationship in User Model:
        The receipts relationship connects the User model to the Receipt model.
        The back_populates="user" parameter establishes a bidirectional relationship. The user attribute in the Receipt model and the receipts attribute in the User model are now linked.

    Cascade Behavior:
        Adding cascade="all, delete-orphan" ensures that when a User is deleted, all their associated Receipt records are also deleted.
